You know everybody. Oh, lovely to be here with you near Erin's. Move it. Right. So if you haven't heard of, move it before, I got a few statistics. I want to read out to you by way of recap two thousand six hundred cities, eighty five countries and forty four languages. That's absolutely huge. Thank you. Yes, it's quite amazing to think about it when we just started six years ago, and this quarter we just cross the three hundred million users milestone side by side. With the coverage you've just mentioned, we do cover the largest area on the globe in regards off public transit information. We actually add a service in a new city every fifteen hours, every fifteen hours. We had a new city to our repository, and we're serving hundreds of millions of people around the world. So can you describe in a sentence? But move it actually is so moving is actually today the aggregation off all mobility options that people have within the urban area, excluding driving a car. So it's all about public transit information combined with on demande ride, hailing scooters and bikes, which can take each and every one of you from point A to point B in any given time. So it's pretty much something that every single one of us in this room can relate to. We've all used public transport of one point or another and used technology in order to decide how we're going to get from A to B. But the big thing that really strikes me about movies is the sheer scale of what you're doing. Can you take us through like the narrative of how you got to the point where you are today? So I think that what help us to get where we are today is a very early understanding that only fifteen percent of the cities back then six years ago were actually had transit information aggregated in a way that you could do something with it. So as much as it looks like a huge obstacle or a challenge, we saw that as an amazing opportunity to scale. Because once you able to bring transit information to people on the street, they will very much adopted very quickly. You've been described as the Wikipedia of transit, and we'll talk about that in a second cause. That's kind of like a headline for you. What? I believe you have another headline you'd like to share with us today. Yes, I want to take this opportunity today in front of you guys, that Web summit to announce globally that we have just signed a strategic agreement with Microsoft, the second largest company in the world to provide them all our transit data is part ofthe Microsoft Azure Maps services. In this case, Microsoft, I'm sure pretty much looked around who can provide their the most comprehensive and most accurate transit data, and we're so proud to be selected to be Microsoft partner on that aspect. And by doing that, we will allow now hundreds of thousands off developers around the world, using as your cloud services to get the most comprehensive public transit data available through their air P I So we're very excited about this partnership, and I'm quite sure that it will contribute to so many different businesses around the world. I'm going to be a bit bold or slightly cheeky. And the next question I ask you, where does that put you when you think about real heavyweights of maps like Google, for example. So I can You know very easily say that on the transit level, moving today have about seventy per cent more coverage than Google Maps Way actually can immediately connect that to your previous remark about the Wikipedia off off transportation and the reason why we have so much coverage and so much information is a lot of it is thanks to our amazing global community of volunteers. I want to tell you something very interesting. I mean out off the three hundred million people that we have his users, about one percent volunteered actively to help us build transit data, and I'll tell you another secret. Not all of them were technically capable to do it. But out of this amazing group, about four hundred thousand seventy for seventy five thousand people were qualified as local editors. And this is what makes move. It's so unique and give us such a huge power to build and maintain transit data around the world and make us, as I said before, by far the largest repository for transit data. So, like almost half a million people volunteering to essentially crowdsource for you, how do you maintain the quality control and the accuracy of the information of data that's been collected, That's it. Excellent question, because none of these editors are allowed to publish data without monitoring process. So we have build very organized and sophisticated hierarchy level between our volunteers. So whenever somebody just, you know published transit information, it goes through an approval process by other people that has to go and check and approve this data as you get higher scores who have bean promoted in this pyramid off. Editors. So we have, like, several degrees or seven layers off. Editors. You start at the lower level and you have been promoted all the way to a city manager, region manager, country manager. Eventually, at the end, at the top, these other guys, we called ambassadors. So they are all volunteers and there, managing this amazing pyramid off almost half a million people. So I'm sure you've got a massive vault of information that you conclude mean lots of learnings from. Can I ask you, Are there any real practical examples ofthe insights that you have learned about a transport ecosystem in a city that has really informed the way in which that infrastructure and planning happens? So we are collecting today completely anonymously. About four billion data points a day. Think about it. Four billion data points a day and we aggregate this information statistically, Most of this information is about people's movement within cities. When we take this amazing repository and we analyze it, we get very interesting conclusions. I want to share with you one of our researchers that we have done in Boston to try and understand why people are driving their car into the city. And there's a train line for McCown train line that is about forty miles going into Boston and has like eighteen train stations in the suburbs. When we analyze people movement, we identified a very interesting phenomena at seven thirty. Pretty much in the morning, which is the worst hour to drive your car into the city. The number of people who drove into the city went up fifty percent, and it was almost unreal to see this phenomena. But when we analyze people's movement, what we saw is that people are actually driving into the train stations at the suburbs, turn around and drive to the city. And there was one main reason. No more parking spots. So if you think about this phenomena from a city perspective before you could have this people's movement data. City planners were quite blind about this phenomena, and now they have multiple things they can do to solve it. They can add more parking spots, which is very expensive real estate. Or they can increase number off buses. Or, you know, the frequency of the bus is which is also not very efficient. But think about a new solution. Why don't they take some subsidy and give it to Wright, hailing companies like Uber or Lift or Dede and drive people into the train station so they don't need to park their car there so information can reveal so many different phenomenons that can improve our lives without adding Mohr infrastructure, You've tapped into two things I want to ask you about. Probably separately. One is you've mentioned uber and lift, and to me it's impossible to talk about public transport without thinking about star tops or media. Companies. Are tech companies that have completely disrupted the whole ecosystem on You know how that's regulated and how that off it's on. The second thing is, you know what kind of decision makers do with the type of data that you are gathering because there's clearly a valuable commodity here in terms of the the information that you have, How can that be used? Who needs to actually get involved in order to make meaningful changes so that it can improve people's lives in getting from A to B and potentially improve the environment as well? Climate change, lots of other issues, too. So I'll start with the second question. Maybe it's almost clear to think that in order to improve our transportation in cities, you need to invest in infrastructure. We claimed that before you do that with the current existing infrastructure, once you have more insights about how people movin what how did demand look like? There's many ways to go and optimize the existing infrastructure change frequency of buses, reduce some if it's not needed, increased somewhere it needed. And it's a lot about revealing new information for the city planners and municipalities. So I would say that before you go and invest in your infrastructure, data can or the data that can be revealed in the last five or ten years changes the whole concept off. What do we know about the demand in the supply in the city and moving. I think it's a great site. You go ahead. But before you go into lifting over one of the things that I guess a lot of people are thinking about now is there data where goes and who actually has access to it on DH risks that is potentially involved with us? And how would you lay those concerns that people might have about their own private lives and about their personal security and their whereabouts and those kind of things? So we had moving decided from day one that we're not going to aggregate or store any personal information. I think that the easiest way to deal with it is to try and look at the data on a statistical aspects of it. I mean, we aggregate every ride. We take this information completely anonymously, and eventually, when it it's aggregated. Statistically, there's no way to go back and check on a personal behavior own move. Also, the data that we collect from users has nothing to do with their contact list or their personal information. It just a collection of moving points on the map. So we're trying very hard to stay away from collecting any person information, which is difficult to do in this day and age. You know, off. All of the big tech companies are having lots of challenges grappling with that. I agree, and it really depends on the type or the nature of business you want. And what would you like to achieve when, when When we look at goals that are only related to mass transit, then we don't really need to deal with the dilemmas that relates to advertisement or any other dilemmas. The relates to collecting personal information. So let's talk about uber lift and lots of other new modes of transport that we have to look forward to that are really shaking things up. So there's no doubt that right hailing phenomena is here to stay. We're all using it around the world. It's amazing, but we see a very clear process where the disrupting companies, our match much faster and much more agile then cities and regulators. So the phenomena looks like their first starting and growing in a city, and it takes sometimes years for cities to digest what's going on and start operating their regulatory forces to balance the phenomena. We saw that with the right hailing that started to be regulated. Lately, we clearly see that with other mobility phenomenons like scooters that are spread all over the city and in some cities it becomes really hazard to walk on DH in between these scooters. But eventually, if we think five to fifteen years forward, there will be a balance between the very strong necessity of these services. They're becoming complimentary services to mass transit in how regulators can make sure that their balance, demand and supply. Uh, the example I gave about Boston can easily be sold. If only five percent off the subsidy that city of Boston or in the U. S. Gives buses will be shifted to write, hailing too over lift. Whoever would like to take these people from home to the train station in a more efficient way. So there's also a very positive future for that kind of relationship. What about taking action on the movement of vehicles through cities such as a congestion charge? I mean, in the UK in London, where I live, there's a congestion charge on cars going through the city, and it's a deterrent for people, too. I go there, you have all of the data, so you have the inside track on what needs to be done. Yes, and I think we're not really generating this phenomena but way. Watch it very closely. As you can see in Europe, more and more cities starting to restrict areas on DH prevent private cars from getting into these areas. That kind off decision has to come with a very tight solution for public transit. Otherwise, you know it will kill the area. In a way, you see today that regulatory forces prevent big, new big buildings to have too many parking spaces because they don't want cars to get into the city. It's a phenomena that we're looking. We're watching it from a statistical perspective, but it's also something there. We're trying to help and explain or help cities understand what solutions they have to provide before they take these actions in restricted areas, from letting car getting into these areas or getting any congestion fees. We have just over a minute left. But if you could recap based on the things that you have learned over the last six years. I'm not asking you for all of your trade secrets. Where do you see the future of urban transport going? I definitely tried to combine all the new initiatives that start from the disrupting. Right Helling companies together with what are we going to see in the next five to fifteen years with autonomous vehicles phenomena? And one thing is pretty clear to us. Mass transit is here to stay. One rail can move. Thirty five thousand people in our one. Once one Carlene can only transfer two thousand people in ours. So we all understand that mass transit is here to stay. But what I believe will happen is that the friction? Yeah, we have today about moving between one mode of transportation to another will start to eliminate, to be eliminated by the fact that we'll pay one up to have the full trip that includes a train, a bus or an autonomous vehicle or even a scooter. So I think the multi modality is going to be the future off our urban or our urban mobility by all means, payment and usage off different modes of transportation near areas that's been absolutely absolute pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much. You know what you do next? Move it. Thank you. Thank you.
