00:03.439 --> 00:08.619
right. Let's talk about how Salesforce has weathered this

00:08.619 --> 00:16.050
pandemic in this economic crisis. Um, everyone went

00:16.050 --> 00:20.050
through an accelerated digital transformation, and I assume even

00:20.050 --> 00:22.969
a digital company like Salesforce had to do it.

00:24.039 --> 00:25.609
How long did it tell you? Take you to

00:25.609 --> 00:29.140
get on your feet to get your bearings? Yeah

00:29.140 --> 00:30.429
, that's absolutely right. I mean, it's It's

00:30.429 --> 00:35.229
almost embarrassing when you're a technology company and you encounter

00:35.229 --> 00:37.789
your like this because it shows all the cracks in

00:37.789 --> 00:40.560
the foundation, right? All the all the ways

00:40.560 --> 00:43.909
you depended on your office space and all the all

00:43.909 --> 00:45.979
the parts of your business that weren't digital. You

00:45.979 --> 00:47.509
know, the term that I use for the for

00:47.509 --> 00:50.030
that feeling in marches, paralysis, you know,

00:50.030 --> 00:52.390
we just you know, as you know, we're

00:52.390 --> 00:55.750
in event oriented company. We have 200,000 people descend

00:55.750 --> 00:58.310
on San Francisco for Dream Force. Every year we're

00:58.320 --> 01:02.340
on airplanes in our customers offices, and I think

01:02.340 --> 01:07.030
it was the that sense of unfamiliarity that really lead

01:07.030 --> 01:10.269
Thio. I think a paralysis particularly for our customer

01:10.269 --> 01:11.930
facing teams, you know, that are used to

01:11.930 --> 01:12.879
being, you know, face to face with our

01:12.879 --> 01:15.689
customers on board, you know, I don't know

01:15.689 --> 01:18.310
if it was a month or a few weeks.

01:18.319 --> 01:19.549
It felt like forever. At the time, I

01:19.549 --> 01:23.340
could tell you that. Andi, I think that

01:23.349 --> 01:26.700
we we really had to be intentional about transforming our

01:26.700 --> 01:30.140
culture in the face of what we've been calling this

01:30.150 --> 01:33.269
all digital work anywhere world that we're in right now

01:33.939 --> 01:36.260
. Andi, when I say intentional kind of goes

01:36.260 --> 01:38.920
back to our roots, we do in all hands

01:38.930 --> 01:42.349
with all 54,000 employees every week. And we have

01:42.349 --> 01:44.430
since the beginning, the pandemic. We literally have

01:44.430 --> 01:47.319
not done that since Mark and Parker started this place

01:47.319 --> 01:48.989
21 years ago, you know, But we have

01:49.000 --> 01:51.469
54,000 people on the zoom call. You know,

01:51.469 --> 01:53.799
it's crazy and we're really focused on, you know

01:53.810 --> 01:57.180
, how do you work today? We have this

01:57.180 --> 02:00.900
small we call participation, which means just get on

02:00.900 --> 02:01.640
the phone, ask your customer how they can help

02:01.650 --> 02:04.980
. How can you help them right now? It's

02:04.980 --> 02:07.069
about relevance, you know, it's saying, Hey

02:07.140 --> 02:08.479
, all these technologies we've had for a long time

02:08.479 --> 02:12.229
, but what's a relevant conversation today is pretty different

02:12.229 --> 02:14.229
than it. Waas. Ah, few weeks ago

02:14.229 --> 02:16.060
, a few months ago. And it's about enablement

02:16.069 --> 02:17.550
, you know, which is really saying, How

02:17.550 --> 02:21.819
could we train every single employee in the new way

02:21.830 --> 02:23.469
that they have to work on? Do we really

02:23.469 --> 02:28.870
adopted those principles? Participation, relevance, enablement And

02:28.870 --> 02:30.780
again, this kind of operating cadence that is very

02:30.780 --> 02:34.729
intentional, very active kind of a culture of action

02:34.729 --> 02:36.819
is way I describe it, and I think it's

02:36.819 --> 02:38.069
really helped us get through the initial stages, the

02:38.069 --> 02:40.400
pandemic. And now I feel like we're really firing

02:40.400 --> 02:47.009
on all cylinders. What was the most surprising barrier

02:47.009 --> 02:52.780
that you encountered in this process? You know,

02:52.780 --> 02:58.830
I think, um, mhm the every single department

02:58.840 --> 03:00.300
, every single function had to change at the same

03:00.300 --> 03:02.990
time. And so, you know, you really

03:02.990 --> 03:08.020
realized where people were sort of dependent on the machinery

03:08.030 --> 03:10.009
of a large company. You know, whether it

03:10.009 --> 03:15.879
was your sales executive and you're dependent on showing up

03:15.879 --> 03:17.090
to these events to engage with your customers, and

03:17.090 --> 03:20.430
all of a sudden that's gone and you need to

03:20.430 --> 03:23.400
have you know, you need to be personally proactive

03:23.400 --> 03:24.930
to do it. You're a marketer, depending on

03:24.930 --> 03:30.120
the standard ways that you generate leads on all of

03:30.120 --> 03:31.990
a sudden. All of those channels are not available

03:31.990 --> 03:34.370
to you, and the one channel left, which

03:34.370 --> 03:37.800
is digital, is completely saturated because every company in

03:37.800 --> 03:39.729
the world went there overnight. And what I would

03:39.729 --> 03:44.900
say is that really demands a beginner's mind and it

03:44.900 --> 03:47.990
creativity that I don't think every individual at every company

03:47.990 --> 03:52.360
really has. And and I think it's fascinating.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.080
Yeah, so it's a principle. I think Marc

03:54.090 --> 03:57.300
Benioff really embraces that I love. I love that

03:57.300 --> 04:00.110
principle, you know, and sort of an expert

04:00.110 --> 04:02.090
mind, you know, on Lee knows one possibility

04:02.099 --> 04:05.960
for an a beginner's mind. Everything's a possibility.

04:06.039 --> 04:09.439
And I think in the age of you know,

04:09.449 --> 04:12.419
covid-ninteen, it's really multiple crises at the same time

04:12.419 --> 04:15.520
a health crisis, an economic crisis, a social

04:15.520 --> 04:17.259
justice crisis, a leadership crisis in this country.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.800
You know, you need to show up and say

04:19.800 --> 04:23.470
, Okay, I need to re imagine how how

04:23.470 --> 04:26.149
we do business on bond. That's what I really

04:26.149 --> 04:27.639
think it was. A big in his mind is

04:27.639 --> 04:29.800
you know, we know what really differentiates us as

04:29.800 --> 04:31.879
a company. Our customers know what differentiates us,

04:31.879 --> 04:36.740
and we're enabling a digital transformation where we're exactly what

04:36.740 --> 04:40.589
our customers need in this moment. But how we

04:40.589 --> 04:43.689
engage with our customers needed to completely transform. And

04:43.699 --> 04:46.509
if you'd asked me last year could you run the

04:46.509 --> 04:48.399
business from home with no events, I would have

04:48.399 --> 04:50.879
laughed at you. Not only did we do that

04:50.879 --> 04:53.730
, we did it with no preparation, you know

04:53.730 --> 04:56.579
, and that's what's really remarkable right now for us

04:56.579 --> 04:59.269
and for all of our customers. I think it's

04:59.269 --> 05:02.410
proof that this new digital way of working is possible

05:02.420 --> 05:04.459
, and I think what's exciting about that when the

05:04.459 --> 05:06.579
spirit of this beginner's mind does, it really begs

05:06.589 --> 05:09.870
the question. How are we gonna work on the

05:09.870 --> 05:11.360
other side of this? You know, when it's

05:11.360 --> 05:14.220
not imposed on us and we got stuck in our

05:14.220 --> 05:15.680
home office is because we have to be, You

05:15.680 --> 05:18.720
know, now that we've proven as a society that

05:18.730 --> 05:21.209
hey, I can order groceries online and you know

05:21.209 --> 05:25.509
meetings don't necessarily need to be in person when that

05:25.509 --> 05:28.649
all becomes optional. What is the transform version of

05:28.649 --> 05:30.480
ourselves on the other side? And that's what I'm

05:30.480 --> 05:33.829
really excited about across our customer base actually is really

05:33.829 --> 05:38.279
seeing the leaders who are treating this as an opportunity

05:38.279 --> 05:40.930
to transform rather than just a crisis to respond.

05:40.930 --> 05:45.649
Thio. So what do you see on the other

05:45.649 --> 05:47.540
side of this for? For Salesforce in particular?

05:47.540 --> 05:49.149
I mean, how how is it going to change

05:49.149 --> 05:50.959
the way you operate, the way you get your

05:50.959 --> 05:55.759
work done? It's a great question. It is

05:55.759 --> 05:58.149
the most challenging question to answer. I laughed,

05:58.149 --> 06:00.009
predicting the future of this year feels sort of comically

06:00.009 --> 06:01.879
hard, because I wouldn't have been right at any

06:01.879 --> 06:03.649
point. You know, it's every every time I

06:03.649 --> 06:05.680
think I've figured out this year. Some new crazy

06:05.680 --> 06:09.290
thing happens. But with that caveat, you know

06:09.290 --> 06:11.879
, right now, I would say it has proven

06:11.879 --> 06:15.649
that this all digital work anywhere world can work like

06:15.649 --> 06:17.290
we can work in this environment. So it does

06:17.300 --> 06:19.350
beg the question about what is the role of the

06:19.350 --> 06:24.050
office? What is the role of a headquarters on

06:24.050 --> 06:27.610
Bond? I'll start with a few sort of sober

06:27.610 --> 06:29.319
realities. One is, I think this year is

06:29.319 --> 06:30.769
not sustainable for a lot of our employees. We

06:30.769 --> 06:34.060
measure this, and on average, our employees have

06:34.060 --> 06:39.300
1.7 more hours of meetings on their calendar every day

06:39.310 --> 06:42.449
. Uh, this pandemic than before. In June

06:42.449 --> 06:45.149
, we surveyed our customers, and only 23% of

06:45.149 --> 06:47.069
people want to return to the office. We today

06:47.069 --> 06:50.759
that 72% people are clamoring for, you know,

06:50.769 --> 06:56.610
some semblance of normalcy. Other hand, I think

06:56.620 --> 06:58.319
, you know, I was talking to Matt Mullen

06:58.329 --> 07:00.089
because the CEO of WordPress, which is one of

07:00.089 --> 07:02.269
the largest content management systems in the world, but

07:02.269 --> 07:05.470
notably it's a company that's been distributed from day one

07:05.480 --> 07:08.300
s. I laugh all of a sudden he is

07:08.300 --> 07:11.100
the expert on what we're all experiencing, and he

07:11.100 --> 07:12.399
made a really good point to me. What you

07:12.399 --> 07:15.709
said. We're not really experiencing distributed work in the

07:15.709 --> 07:17.149
way that I thought of when I created WordPress.

07:17.139 --> 07:20.009
We're experience of pandemic i e. It's been imposed

07:20.009 --> 07:23.839
upon us as opposed to an intentional design of our

07:23.839 --> 07:26.420
culture. And so what I would say is on

07:26.420 --> 07:29.370
the other side of this, now that we've really

07:29.370 --> 07:31.790
learned that we can operate in this distributed way,

07:31.800 --> 07:33.709
I think it's going to really change the way we

07:33.709 --> 07:36.240
think about our physical spaces, you know, maybe

07:36.240 --> 07:40.180
more purpose driven. Maybe people don't We have assigned

07:40.180 --> 07:43.810
desks. Maybe it's more neighborhood seating. Maybe instead

07:43.810 --> 07:45.759
of saying, you know, we're gonna work away

07:45.759 --> 07:47.220
from the office on Fridays were to say, Hey

07:47.230 --> 07:49.470
, everyone's gonna work in the office on Thursday so

07:49.470 --> 07:53.790
that we really are focused on teaming rather than treating

07:53.790 --> 07:56.839
remote work is an individual decision. E think all

07:56.839 --> 07:58.730
of these things will, I think, for the

07:58.730 --> 08:03.000
companies that really are intentional about building their cultures.

08:03.009 --> 08:05.250
Um, I think it's really amazing opportunity because one

08:05.250 --> 08:07.930
of the things that I think it does mean is

08:07.930 --> 08:09.569
you can recruit from, or geography ease. It

08:09.569 --> 08:13.920
can get you know, your employees working parents just

08:13.920 --> 08:16.550
a ton more flexibility if we do it right,

08:16.560 --> 08:18.050
s. So I'm kind of looking forward to the

08:18.050 --> 08:20.089
day where you don't have the stress of it feeling

08:20.089 --> 08:22.399
imposed on you. And you could really say,

08:22.399 --> 08:26.300
How do we treat the lessons of 2020 as an

08:26.300 --> 08:28.970
asset that we can use to transform our culture going

08:28.970 --> 08:31.889
forward? That is definitely a lot of us are

08:31.889 --> 08:35.950
thinking about that. And it will be fascinating when

08:35.639 --> 08:41.269
the context isn't as frightening as it is now to

08:41.269 --> 08:45.049
think about it with a clearer head. Um,

08:45.539 --> 08:48.000
you know, you said that you mentioned the culture

08:48.000 --> 08:52.779
a couple of times. Salesforce has 50,000 plus employees

08:52.789 --> 08:58.440
. How how do you shift your culture when you're

08:58.440 --> 09:01.929
50,000 plus employees in what must be dozens and dozens

09:01.940 --> 09:05.259
of markets, all all of your employees working from

09:05.259 --> 09:09.159
home? How do you How do you align and

09:09.159 --> 09:13.840
how do you ship your culture? It is a

09:13.840 --> 09:16.279
really interesting question, and, um well, first

09:16.279 --> 09:18.799
, I'll say that we've been really intentional about building

09:18.799 --> 09:22.350
our culture. I think every great company is and

09:22.350 --> 09:24.620
should be on DWI really take great pride that our

09:24.620 --> 09:28.639
culture isn't just, um, looking inwards at our

09:28.639 --> 09:31.320
employees. It's really something that we express to our

09:31.320 --> 09:35.250
customers into our partners into our communities. And it's

09:35.250 --> 09:37.460
why, from day one, every salesforce tower across

09:37.460 --> 09:39.129
the globe, we have many of them. In

09:39.129 --> 09:43.590
many major cities, we have the top floor is

09:43.590 --> 09:46.250
called the Ohana floor, and it's a floor that

09:46.250 --> 09:48.860
is actually available not just us but to our partners

09:48.860 --> 09:50.350
into the community, to use for, for example

09:50.350 --> 09:54.240
, for charity fundraisers. It's the reason why you

09:54.240 --> 09:56.860
go to ah Salesforce event like one of our world

09:56.860 --> 09:58.929
tours or dream force. It looks like our offices

09:58.929 --> 10:01.960
and our offices look like our events, you know

10:01.960 --> 10:03.610
? And it's, uh, we really try to

10:03.610 --> 10:05.740
say that our culture is something that we want to

10:05.740 --> 10:07.200
be, not a poster on the cafeteria wall,

10:07.200 --> 10:09.850
and that's something superficial, like our culture is something

10:09.850 --> 10:11.960
that is part of our events. It's a part

10:11.960 --> 10:15.149
of the way we express ourselves to our community.

10:15.639 --> 10:16.659
Um, and it's interesting when I gave all those

10:16.659 --> 10:20.240
examples those events, the office space is a lot

10:20.240 --> 10:22.289
of those have gone away. And so it really

10:22.289 --> 10:24.399
begs the question in this, you know, distributed

10:24.399 --> 10:26.500
, all digital world were in. How do you

10:26.500 --> 10:28.539
imbue culture? How do you onboard new employees to

10:28.539 --> 10:31.779
our culture? I think we've done a good job

10:31.779 --> 10:33.409
. As I said, just by being intentional,

10:33.419 --> 10:35.129
you know, we've spent a lot of time really

10:35.129 --> 10:37.419
focusing on, you know, culture not being again

10:37.419 --> 10:41.840
from the superficial values on the on the coffee next

10:41.840 --> 10:43.399
to the coffee machine. This is something I think

10:43.409 --> 10:46.730
all of our employees can really articulate. You also

10:46.730 --> 10:50.889
wonder how much are we borrowing from culture that we've

10:50.889 --> 10:52.720
built pre pandemic. You know, if this continued

10:52.720 --> 10:56.139
on for five more years, would your culture start

10:56.139 --> 10:58.679
toe have cracks in the foundation, and I can't

10:58.679 --> 11:01.120
say that I have. You know, I think

11:01.120 --> 11:01.549
that's part of it. I really dio you know

11:01.549 --> 11:05.429
. And so I really think when I think about

11:05.429 --> 11:05.879
culture going forward, I think one of the things

11:05.879 --> 11:09.230
I would say is it's really inclusive concept. You

11:09.230 --> 11:11.269
know, culture is something that you need to really

11:11.269 --> 11:13.710
authentically live, because culture is not something in posting

11:13.710 --> 11:16.909
the top culture is something that you experience when you

11:16.909 --> 11:20.789
interact with your colleagues and that your customers experience when

11:20.789 --> 11:24.179
they interact with you on DSO. I do believe

11:24.179 --> 11:26.629
that we maintain that, you know, really inclusive

11:26.629 --> 11:28.080
view of culture or something we can maintain even in

11:28.080 --> 11:31.889
this in this new way of working, I wonder

11:31.889 --> 11:35.659
if you'd be willing to share with our audience.

11:35.669 --> 11:37.690
Um, some of the mistakes you may have made

11:37.690 --> 11:41.139
along the way. You know, if we ever

11:41.139 --> 11:46.850
face another crisis again of the breath of the one

11:46.850 --> 11:48.710
we're facing now, what will you know not to

11:48.710 --> 11:54.360
dio It is a great question and it's something I've

11:54.360 --> 11:56.460
actually talked to a lot of our customers about as

11:56.460 --> 11:58.200
well What high level pattern I will give you some

11:58.200 --> 12:03.080
examples is where we didn't change fast enough. You

12:03.080 --> 12:03.470
know, I think that in the beginning of this

12:03.470 --> 12:07.179
pandemic, every CEO I talked Thio would talk about

12:07.179 --> 12:09.389
the crisis is something that they would weather, you

12:09.389 --> 12:13.330
know, something that they would get through so that

12:13.330 --> 12:15.450
on the other side they could go back to business

12:15.450 --> 12:18.250
as usual. All of the customers in our customer

12:18.250 --> 12:22.809
base and all areas where we've done better to or

12:22.809 --> 12:26.320
where we lean into the change. There was a

12:26.320 --> 12:30.750
wonderful quote from the chief digital officer of Loreal who

12:30.750 --> 12:33.190
said something along lines of we accomplished in three months

12:33.190 --> 12:35.269
. What would have taken us three years to Dio

12:35.340 --> 12:39.080
? And I think that that there's, you know

12:39.080 --> 12:41.889
, that old colloquialism like Don't let a good crisis

12:41.889 --> 12:45.330
go to waste. I think that's right mentality in

12:45.330 --> 12:46.769
these, which is, you know, um and

12:46.779 --> 12:50.590
Thio answer your question more directly at the beginning.

12:50.590 --> 12:54.350
In our particular customer facing parts of our company,

12:54.840 --> 12:58.500
we treated as something toe wait out and we didn't

12:58.500 --> 13:01.509
lean into Okay, how do we show up for

13:01.509 --> 13:05.820
our customers digitally in a way that's actually compatible this

13:05.820 --> 13:07.649
pandemic? And you know that means that, you

13:07.649 --> 13:11.120
know, we're challenging our teams to say if you're

13:11.120 --> 13:13.990
not on zoom every day with your customers, what

13:13.990 --> 13:15.100
are you doing? You know what? We should

13:15.100 --> 13:16.340
be here to help them in their time of greatest

13:16.340 --> 13:20.360
need. Um, and I think that we didn't

13:20.360 --> 13:22.419
do that right away. We were too cautious,

13:22.429 --> 13:26.740
Andi And I think if we I Your question almost

13:26.740 --> 13:28.169
gives me PTSD because I don't want to experience another

13:28.169 --> 13:31.320
year like this. But if we ever encounter something

13:31.320 --> 13:35.659
like this, I think we're gonna really lean into

13:35.659 --> 13:37.740
the changes implied by the crisis rather than treating the

13:37.740 --> 13:41.250
crisis. Is something temporary, Andi, even if

13:41.250 --> 13:43.809
it is temporary, it just might. We use

13:43.809 --> 13:48.809
is on transform our business. And based on you

13:48.809 --> 13:52.080
know what, you still when we began this conversation

13:52.090 --> 13:54.950
, you said you were in events oriented company and

13:54.950 --> 13:58.399
that, you know, dream Force. If anyone

13:58.399 --> 14:00.950
has ever been in San Francisco for dream force,

14:01.440 --> 14:07.159
it's in San Francisco, right? It iss Yeah

14:07.539 --> 14:09.570
, yeah, it's crazy event. How are you

14:09.570 --> 14:13.389
going to think about events in the future? Yeah

14:13.389 --> 14:15.100
. You know, I think it's going to end

14:15.100 --> 14:16.070
up in and not in, or you know,

14:16.070 --> 14:20.820
I think I'm looking for the welcoming 200,000 people to

14:20.820 --> 14:22.360
San Francisco next year. Knock on wood. Uh

14:22.370 --> 14:24.250
, if this vaccine does what we all hope it

14:24.250 --> 14:28.129
will dio. But what we've really learned is how

14:28.129 --> 14:30.059
to do digital events like the one we're doing right

14:30.059 --> 14:31.960
now. Incredibly valuable, right? You can watch

14:31.960 --> 14:35.659
it in a time shifted way. You can watch

14:35.659 --> 14:37.570
it on your own schedule. Um, the two

14:37.570 --> 14:39.809
of us didn't need to travel to have this conversation

14:39.809 --> 14:41.259
right now, and it probably lowered some of the

14:41.259 --> 14:45.490
barriers to us having this conversation. So I think

14:45.490 --> 14:46.919
when I think about it, and actually I've had

14:46.919 --> 14:48.059
this experience. I've heard this from many executives.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.269
I have conversations with so many CEOs every week,

14:52.279 --> 14:54.820
and I wonder if I would have had that same

14:54.830 --> 14:58.549
level of conversation if we felt like we had to

14:58.549 --> 15:01.580
be in person to have them. So, in

15:01.580 --> 15:03.399
general, what I hope on the other side of

15:03.399 --> 15:05.350
this, for our events and our culture broadly is

15:05.350 --> 15:09.139
embracing what we've learned and making it not snap back

15:09.139 --> 15:11.889
to the way it was, but really augment the

15:11.889 --> 15:16.470
way we run the company. But this has been

15:16.470 --> 15:18.500
so interesting. I wish we could talk for a

15:18.500 --> 15:20.340
now, er, but But unfortunately, unfortunately,

15:20.340 --> 15:22.309
we can't. So I want to thank you.

15:22.309 --> 15:24.600
And I want to thank everyone in our audience for
