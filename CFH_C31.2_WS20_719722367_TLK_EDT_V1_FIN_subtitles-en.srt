1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,619
right. Let's talk about how Salesforce has weathered this

2
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:16,050
pandemic in this economic crisis. Um, everyone went

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,050
through an accelerated digital transformation, and I assume even

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,969
a digital company like Salesforce had to do it.

5
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,609
How long did it tell you? Take you to

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,140
get on your feet to get your bearings? Yeah

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,429
, that's absolutely right. I mean, it's It's

8
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:35,229
almost embarrassing when you're a technology company and you encounter

9
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:37,789
your like this because it shows all the cracks in

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,560
the foundation, right? All the all the ways

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,909
you depended on your office space and all the all

12
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,979
the parts of your business that weren't digital. You

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,509
know, the term that I use for the for

14
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:50,030
that feeling in marches, paralysis, you know,

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,390
we just you know, as you know, we're

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,750
in event oriented company. We have 200,000 people descend

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,310
on San Francisco for Dream Force. Every year we're

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,340
on airplanes in our customers offices, and I think

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,030
it was the that sense of unfamiliarity that really lead

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,269
Thio. I think a paralysis particularly for our customer

21
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:11,930
facing teams, you know, that are used to

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,879
being, you know, face to face with our

23
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,689
customers on board, you know, I don't know

24
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,310
if it was a month or a few weeks.

25
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,549
It felt like forever. At the time, I

26
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,340
could tell you that. Andi, I think that

27
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,700
we we really had to be intentional about transforming our

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,140
culture in the face of what we've been calling this

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,269
all digital work anywhere world that we're in right now

30
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,260
. Andi, when I say intentional kind of goes

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,920
back to our roots, we do in all hands

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,349
with all 54,000 employees every week. And we have

33
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:44,430
since the beginning, the pandemic. We literally have

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,319
not done that since Mark and Parker started this place

35
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,989
21 years ago, you know, But we have

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,469
54,000 people on the zoom call. You know,

37
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,799
it's crazy and we're really focused on, you know

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,180
, how do you work today? We have this

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,900
small we call participation, which means just get on

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,640
the phone, ask your customer how they can help

41
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,980
. How can you help them right now? It's

42
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,069
about relevance, you know, it's saying, Hey

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,479
, all these technologies we've had for a long time

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,229
, but what's a relevant conversation today is pretty different

45
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:14,229
than it. Waas. Ah, few weeks ago

46
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,060
, a few months ago. And it's about enablement

47
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,550
, you know, which is really saying, How

48
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,819
could we train every single employee in the new way

49
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,469
that they have to work on? Do we really

50
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,870
adopted those principles? Participation, relevance, enablement And

51
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,780
again, this kind of operating cadence that is very

52
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,729
intentional, very active kind of a culture of action

53
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,819
is way I describe it, and I think it's

54
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,069
really helped us get through the initial stages, the

55
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,400
pandemic. And now I feel like we're really firing

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,009
on all cylinders. What was the most surprising barrier

57
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:52,780
that you encountered in this process? You know,

58
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,830
I think, um, mhm the every single department

59
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,300
, every single function had to change at the same

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,990
time. And so, you know, you really

61
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,020
realized where people were sort of dependent on the machinery

62
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,009
of a large company. You know, whether it

63
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,879
was your sales executive and you're dependent on showing up

64
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,090
to these events to engage with your customers, and

65
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,430
all of a sudden that's gone and you need to

66
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,400
have you know, you need to be personally proactive

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,930
to do it. You're a marketer, depending on

68
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,120
the standard ways that you generate leads on all of

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,990
a sudden. All of those channels are not available

70
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,370
to you, and the one channel left, which

71
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,800
is digital, is completely saturated because every company in

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,729
the world went there overnight. And what I would

73
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:44,900
say is that really demands a beginner's mind and it

74
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,990
creativity that I don't think every individual at every company

75
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,360
really has. And and I think it's fascinating.

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,080
Yeah, so it's a principle. I think Marc

77
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,300
Benioff really embraces that I love. I love that

78
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,110
principle, you know, and sort of an expert

79
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,090
mind, you know, on Lee knows one possibility

80
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,960
for an a beginner's mind. Everything's a possibility.

81
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,439
And I think in the age of you know,

82
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,419
covid-ninteen, it's really multiple crises at the same time

83
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,520
a health crisis, an economic crisis, a social

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,259
justice crisis, a leadership crisis in this country.

85
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,800
You know, you need to show up and say

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,470
, Okay, I need to re imagine how how

87
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,149
we do business on bond. That's what I really

88
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,639
think it was. A big in his mind is

89
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,800
you know, we know what really differentiates us as

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,879
a company. Our customers know what differentiates us,

91
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,740
and we're enabling a digital transformation where we're exactly what

92
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,589
our customers need in this moment. But how we

93
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,689
engage with our customers needed to completely transform. And

94
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,509
if you'd asked me last year could you run the

95
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:48,399
business from home with no events, I would have

96
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,879
laughed at you. Not only did we do that

97
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,730
, we did it with no preparation, you know

98
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,579
, and that's what's really remarkable right now for us

99
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,269
and for all of our customers. I think it's

100
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:02,410
proof that this new digital way of working is possible

101
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,459
, and I think what's exciting about that when the

102
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,579
spirit of this beginner's mind does, it really begs

103
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,870
the question. How are we gonna work on the

104
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,360
other side of this? You know, when it's

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,220
not imposed on us and we got stuck in our

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,680
home office is because we have to be, You

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
know, now that we've proven as a society that

108
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,209
hey, I can order groceries online and you know

109
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,509
meetings don't necessarily need to be in person when that

110
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,649
all becomes optional. What is the transform version of

111
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,480
ourselves on the other side? And that's what I'm

112
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,829
really excited about across our customer base actually is really

113
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:38,279
seeing the leaders who are treating this as an opportunity

114
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,930
to transform rather than just a crisis to respond.

115
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,649
Thio. So what do you see on the other

116
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,540
side of this for? For Salesforce in particular?

117
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,149
I mean, how how is it going to change

118
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,959
the way you operate, the way you get your

119
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,759
work done? It's a great question. It is

120
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,149
the most challenging question to answer. I laughed,

121
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,009
predicting the future of this year feels sort of comically

122
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,879
hard, because I wouldn't have been right at any

123
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,649
point. You know, it's every every time I

124
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:05,680
think I've figured out this year. Some new crazy

125
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,290
thing happens. But with that caveat, you know

126
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,879
, right now, I would say it has proven

127
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,649
that this all digital work anywhere world can work like

128
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,290
we can work in this environment. So it does

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,350
beg the question about what is the role of the

130
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,050
office? What is the role of a headquarters on

131
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,610
Bond? I'll start with a few sort of sober

132
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,319
realities. One is, I think this year is

133
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,769
not sustainable for a lot of our employees. We

134
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:34,060
measure this, and on average, our employees have

135
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,300
1.7 more hours of meetings on their calendar every day

136
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,449
. Uh, this pandemic than before. In June

137
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,149
, we surveyed our customers, and only 23% of

138
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,069
people want to return to the office. We today

139
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,759
that 72% people are clamoring for, you know,

140
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:56,610
some semblance of normalcy. Other hand, I think

141
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,319
, you know, I was talking to Matt Mullen

142
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,089
because the CEO of WordPress, which is one of

143
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,269
the largest content management systems in the world, but

144
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:05,470
notably it's a company that's been distributed from day one

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,300
s. I laugh all of a sudden he is

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,100
the expert on what we're all experiencing, and he

147
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,399
made a really good point to me. What you

148
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,709
said. We're not really experiencing distributed work in the

149
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,149
way that I thought of when I created WordPress.

150
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,009
We're experience of pandemic i e. It's been imposed

151
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,839
upon us as opposed to an intentional design of our

152
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,420
culture. And so what I would say is on

153
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,370
the other side of this, now that we've really

154
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,790
learned that we can operate in this distributed way,

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,709
I think it's going to really change the way we

156
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:36,240
think about our physical spaces, you know, maybe

157
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,180
more purpose driven. Maybe people don't We have assigned

158
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,810
desks. Maybe it's more neighborhood seating. Maybe instead

159
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,759
of saying, you know, we're gonna work away

160
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,220
from the office on Fridays were to say, Hey

161
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,470
, everyone's gonna work in the office on Thursday so

162
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,790
that we really are focused on teaming rather than treating

163
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,839
remote work is an individual decision. E think all

164
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,730
of these things will, I think, for the

165
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,000
companies that really are intentional about building their cultures.

166
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,250
Um, I think it's really amazing opportunity because one

167
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,930
of the things that I think it does mean is

168
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,569
you can recruit from, or geography ease. It

169
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,920
can get you know, your employees working parents just

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,550
a ton more flexibility if we do it right,

171
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,050
s. So I'm kind of looking forward to the

172
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,089
day where you don't have the stress of it feeling

173
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:22,399
imposed on you. And you could really say,

174
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,300
How do we treat the lessons of 2020 as an

175
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,970
asset that we can use to transform our culture going

176
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,889
forward? That is definitely a lot of us are

177
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,950
thinking about that. And it will be fascinating when

178
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,269
the context isn't as frightening as it is now to

179
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,049
think about it with a clearer head. Um,

180
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,000
you know, you said that you mentioned the culture

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,779
a couple of times. Salesforce has 50,000 plus employees

182
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:58,440
. How how do you shift your culture when you're

183
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,929
50,000 plus employees in what must be dozens and dozens

184
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,259
of markets, all all of your employees working from

185
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,159
home? How do you How do you align and

186
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,840
how do you ship your culture? It is a

187
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,279
really interesting question, and, um well, first

188
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,799
, I'll say that we've been really intentional about building

189
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,350
our culture. I think every great company is and

190
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,620
should be on DWI really take great pride that our

191
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,639
culture isn't just, um, looking inwards at our

192
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,320
employees. It's really something that we express to our

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,250
customers into our partners into our communities. And it's

194
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,460
why, from day one, every salesforce tower across

195
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,129
the globe, we have many of them. In

196
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:43,590
many major cities, we have the top floor is

197
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,250
called the Ohana floor, and it's a floor that

198
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,860
is actually available not just us but to our partners

199
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,350
into the community, to use for, for example

200
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,240
, for charity fundraisers. It's the reason why you

201
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,860
go to ah Salesforce event like one of our world

202
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,929
tours or dream force. It looks like our offices

203
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:01,960
and our offices look like our events, you know

204
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,610
? And it's, uh, we really try to

205
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,740
say that our culture is something that we want to

206
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,200
be, not a poster on the cafeteria wall,

207
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,850
and that's something superficial, like our culture is something

208
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,960
that is part of our events. It's a part

209
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,149
of the way we express ourselves to our community.

210
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,659
Um, and it's interesting when I gave all those

211
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,240
examples those events, the office space is a lot

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,289
of those have gone away. And so it really

213
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,399
begs the question in this, you know, distributed

214
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,500
, all digital world were in. How do you

215
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,539
imbue culture? How do you onboard new employees to

216
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:31,779
our culture? I think we've done a good job

217
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,409
. As I said, just by being intentional,

218
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,129
you know, we've spent a lot of time really

219
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,419
focusing on, you know, culture not being again

220
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:41,840
from the superficial values on the on the coffee next

221
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,399
to the coffee machine. This is something I think

222
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,730
all of our employees can really articulate. You also

223
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,889
wonder how much are we borrowing from culture that we've

224
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,720
built pre pandemic. You know, if this continued

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,139
on for five more years, would your culture start

226
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,679
toe have cracks in the foundation, and I can't

227
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,120
say that I have. You know, I think

228
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,549
that's part of it. I really dio you know

229
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,429
. And so I really think when I think about

230
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:05,879
culture going forward, I think one of the things

231
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,230
I would say is it's really inclusive concept. You

232
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,269
know, culture is something that you need to really

233
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,710
authentically live, because culture is not something in posting

234
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,909
the top culture is something that you experience when you

235
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,789
interact with your colleagues and that your customers experience when

236
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:24,179
they interact with you on DSO. I do believe

237
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,629
that we maintain that, you know, really inclusive

238
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:28,080
view of culture or something we can maintain even in

239
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,889
this in this new way of working, I wonder

240
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:35,659
if you'd be willing to share with our audience.

241
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,690
Um, some of the mistakes you may have made

242
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,139
along the way. You know, if we ever

243
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:46,850
face another crisis again of the breath of the one

244
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,710
we're facing now, what will you know not to

245
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,360
dio It is a great question and it's something I've

246
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,460
actually talked to a lot of our customers about as

247
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,200
well What high level pattern I will give you some

248
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,080
examples is where we didn't change fast enough. You

249
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,470
know, I think that in the beginning of this

250
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,179
pandemic, every CEO I talked Thio would talk about

251
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,389
the crisis is something that they would weather, you

252
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:13,330
know, something that they would get through so that

253
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,450
on the other side they could go back to business

254
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,250
as usual. All of the customers in our customer

255
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,809
base and all areas where we've done better to or

256
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,320
where we lean into the change. There was a

257
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,750
wonderful quote from the chief digital officer of Loreal who

258
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,190
said something along lines of we accomplished in three months

259
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,269
. What would have taken us three years to Dio

260
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,080
? And I think that that there's, you know

261
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,889
, that old colloquialism like Don't let a good crisis

262
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,330
go to waste. I think that's right mentality in

263
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,769
these, which is, you know, um and

264
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,590
Thio answer your question more directly at the beginning.

265
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,350
In our particular customer facing parts of our company,

266
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,500
we treated as something toe wait out and we didn't

267
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,509
lean into Okay, how do we show up for

268
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,820
our customers digitally in a way that's actually compatible this

269
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,649
pandemic? And you know that means that, you

270
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,120
know, we're challenging our teams to say if you're

271
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,990
not on zoom every day with your customers, what

272
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,100
are you doing? You know what? We should

273
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,340
be here to help them in their time of greatest

274
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,360
need. Um, and I think that we didn't

275
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,419
do that right away. We were too cautious,

276
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:26,740
Andi And I think if we I Your question almost

277
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,169
gives me PTSD because I don't want to experience another

278
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:31,320
year like this. But if we ever encounter something

279
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,659
like this, I think we're gonna really lean into

280
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,740
the changes implied by the crisis rather than treating the

281
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,250
crisis. Is something temporary, Andi, even if

282
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,809
it is temporary, it just might. We use

283
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:48,809
is on transform our business. And based on you

284
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,080
know what, you still when we began this conversation

285
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,950
, you said you were in events oriented company and

286
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,399
that, you know, dream Force. If anyone

287
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,950
has ever been in San Francisco for dream force,

288
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,159
it's in San Francisco, right? It iss Yeah

289
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,570
, yeah, it's crazy event. How are you

290
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,389
going to think about events in the future? Yeah

291
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,100
. You know, I think it's going to end

292
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,070
up in and not in, or you know,

293
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,820
I think I'm looking for the welcoming 200,000 people to

294
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,360
San Francisco next year. Knock on wood. Uh

295
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,250
, if this vaccine does what we all hope it

296
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,129
will dio. But what we've really learned is how

297
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:30,059
to do digital events like the one we're doing right

298
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,960
now. Incredibly valuable, right? You can watch

299
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,659
it in a time shifted way. You can watch

300
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,570
it on your own schedule. Um, the two

301
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,809
of us didn't need to travel to have this conversation

302
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,259
right now, and it probably lowered some of the

303
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,490
barriers to us having this conversation. So I think

304
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,919
when I think about it, and actually I've had

305
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,059
this experience. I've heard this from many executives.

306
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,269
I have conversations with so many CEOs every week,

307
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,820
and I wonder if I would have had that same

308
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,549
level of conversation if we felt like we had to

309
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:01,580
be in person to have them. So, in

310
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,399
general, what I hope on the other side of

311
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,350
this, for our events and our culture broadly is

312
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,139
embracing what we've learned and making it not snap back

313
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,889
to the way it was, but really augment the

314
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,470
way we run the company. But this has been

315
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,500
so interesting. I wish we could talk for a

316
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,340
now, er, but But unfortunately, unfortunately,

317
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,309
we can't. So I want to thank you.

318
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,600
And I want to thank everyone in our audience for
